# pictrix

CLI for creating and declaring a coherent colorscheme in one place and applying it
nearly everywhere - even on websites! Integrated with NixOS and Home Manager 
(but works on other Linux distros, too). 

Note: This is a new project and while I anticipate rapid development, it will
remain a work in progress for some time. Suggestions welcome!
